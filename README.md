# Word Finder

A web application for searching and filtering words using regex and keyboard constraints ‚Äî inspired by games like [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Decipher](https://decipher.wtf/).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This app is hosted on Render's free plan, and may take up to 60 seconds to spin up initially. After startup, all subsequent requests are significantly faster. If the app sits idle for 15 minutes, it will shut down and require another cold start.  

## Project Structure  

### Python Backend  
- Flask API  
- Uses the [Wordle word list](https://github.com/seanpatlan/wordle-words.git), which contains the official daily words.  
- Incorporates NLTK word list, sorted by how commonly it is found in the English language.  

### Static Frontend  
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  


<!-- ## Getting Started

### Backend

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the backend server:
   ```sh
   python backend/main.py
   ```

### Frontend

Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser. The frontend expects the backend to be running at `http://localhost:5000`.
